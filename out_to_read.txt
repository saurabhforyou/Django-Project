Note

 

An estimated average glucose (eAG) can be calculated from the HbAic values. The Alc test is also used to monitor the glucose
control of diabetics over time. This helps to minimize the complications caused by chronically elevated glucose levels, such as
progressive damage to kidneys, eyes, cardiovascular system, and nerves.

The Aic test, however, should not be used for screening for cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, people who have had recent severe
bleeding or blood transfusions, those with chronic kidney or liver disease, or people with blood disorders such as iron-deficiency
anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency anemia, and some Hemoglobin variants (e.g., patients with sickle cell disease or Thalassemia).

FERRITIN, Serum, (CLIA) 108.6 23.90 - 336.20 ng/ml

Summary and Explanation of the Test:

 

Ferritin is a compound composed of iron molecules bound to apoferritin, a protein shell. Stored iron represents about 25% of
total iron in the body, and most of this iron is stored as ferritin.Ferritin is found in many body cells, but especially those in the
liver, spleen, bone marrow, and in  reticuloendothelial cells.Ferritin plays a significant role in the absorption, storage, and release
of iron. As the storage form of iron, ferritin remains in the body tissues until it is needed for erythropoiesis. When needed, the
iron molecules are released from the apoferitin shell and bind to transferrin, the circulating plasma protein that transports iron to
the erythropoietic cells.Although dietary iron is poorly absorbed, the body conserves its iron stores carefully, reabsorbing most of
the iron released from the breakdown of red blood cells. As a result, the body normally loses only 1to 2mg of iron per day,
which is generally restored by the iron absorbed in the small intestine from dietary sources.Ferritin is found in serum in low
concentrations and is directly proportional to the body~s iron  stores.Serum ferritin concentration, when analyzed with other
factors such as serum iron, iron-binding capacity, and tissue iron stores, is valuable in the diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemias,
anemias of chronic infection, and conditions such as thalassemia and hemochromatosis that are associated with iron overload.
Measurement of serum ferritin is particularly valuable in distinguishing iron-deficiency anemias caused by low iron stores from
those resulting from inadequate iron utilization.

Limitations:

 

 

Serum ferritin values are elevated in the presence of the following conditions and do not reflect actual body iron stores:

- inflammation - significant tissue destruction - liver disease
- malignancies such as acute leukemia and Hodgkin,s disease - therapy with iron supplements

FOLATE, Serum,(CLIA) 10.0 4.50 - 32.20 ng/ml

Summary and Explanation of the Test

Folates are compounds of pteroyiglutamic acid (PGA) that function as coenzymes. Folate, with vitamin B12, is essential for DNA
synthesis, which is required for normal red blood cell maturation. Humans obtain folate from dietary sources including fruits,
green and leafy vegetables, yeast, and organ meats. Folate is absorbed through the small intestine and stored in the liver Low
folate intake, malabsorption as a result of gastrointestinal diseases, pregnancy, and drugs such as phenytoin are causes of folate
deficiency. Folate deficiency is also associated with chronic alcoholism. Folate and vitamin B12 deficiency impair DNA synthesis,
causing macrocytic anemias. These anemias are characterized by abnormal maturation of red blood cell precursors in the bone
marrow, the presence of megaloblasts, and decreased red blood cell survival. Since both folate and vitamin B12 deficiency can
cause macrocytic anemia, appropriate treatment depends on the differential diagnosis of the deficiency. Serum _ folate
measurement provides an early index of folate status. However, folate is much more concentrated in red blood cells than in
serum so the red blood cell folate measurement more closely reflects tissue stores.4Red blood cell folate concentration is
considered the most reliable indicator of folate status.

Limitations

Hemolysis significantly increases folate values due to the high folate concentrations in red
blood cells. Methotrexate and leucovorin interfere with folate measurement because these
drugs cross-react with folate binding proteins.

INSULIN FASTING, Serum, (CLIA) 9.40 2.60 - 24.90 uU/ml
Comments:
INSULIN PP, Serum,(CLIA) 11.83 4.00 - 56.00 mu/L

Summary and Explanation of the Test

 

Insulin is a protein hormone that is synthesized, stored, and secreted by the beta cells located in the islets of Langerhans in the
pancreas. Insulin is responsible for regulating glucose concentrations in the blood. Initially in the beta cells, insulin exists as a
large molecule (MW ~12000) called preproinsulin.

Insulin is released in response to the presence of glucose in the blood typically after the ingestion of a meal. A normal healthy
individual produces 40to SQunits of insulin each day. The half-life of insulin in serum or plasma is Sto 10 minutes.
Approximately 50% of the insulin released into the portal circulation is cleared by the liver. Insulin binds to receptor cells located
on cell membranes of target tissues. The target tissues are primarily liver, fat, and muscle tissue. Insulin lowers glucose
concentrations in the blood by stimulating glycogenolysis in the liver, triglyceride synthesis in adipose tissue, and _ protein
synthesis in muscle. Recent studies have indicated that insulin and insulin receptors may play a role in learning and memory. The
interruption of insulin production and insulin receptor activity may lead to deficits in learning and memory formation. Increased
insulin production is common in the development of cancers. If insulin production is not stimulated, blood glucose levels will not
be lowered and hyperglycemia results. Fasting hyperglycemia supports the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.

There are two types of diabetes mellitus: type I or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and type I or
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Insulin therapy is used for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) _ patients
and many non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients. In type I diabetes (IDDM) there is a deficiency of insulin.
This can be the result of autoimmune destruction of the beta cells or the presence of autoantibodies to insulin. Many factors can
play a role in the development of Type II diabetes (NIDDM). Type II diabetes (NIDDM) can result if there is a decreased
biological response to circulating insulin (insulin resistance) or if there is decreased or diminished insulin secretion due to beta cell
failure. Insulin levels are not typically used in the diagnosis or management of diabetic patients. Insulin levels can be useful in
evaluating patients with fasting hypoglycemia, in determining insulin resistance in the general population, and in assessing
abnormalities in beta cell secretory function. Insulin levels are used in studying the pathophysiology of diabetes.

Limitations

 

Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with reagent immunoglobulins, interfering with in vitro immunoassays. Patients
routinely exposed to animals or to animal serum roducts can be prone to this interference and anomalous values may be
observed. Additional information may be required for diagnosis. Insulin autoantibodies in human serum may interfere and cause
discordant results.

Summary and Explanation of the Test

 

Vitamin B12, or cyanocobalamin, is a complex corrinoid compound containing four pyrrole rings that surround a single cobalt
atom. Humans obtain vitamin B12exclusively from animal dietary sources, such as meat, eggs, and milk. Vitamin B12 requires
intrinsic factor, a protein secreted by the parietal cells in the gastric mucosa, for absorption. Vitamin B12 and intrinsic factor form
a complex that attaches to receptors in the ileal mucosa, where proteins known as trans-cobalamins transport the vitamin B12
from the mucosal cells to the blood and tissues. Most vitamin B12is stored in the liver as well as in the bone marrow and other
tissues. Vitamin B12and folate are critical to normal DNA synthesis, which in turn affects erythrocyte maturation. Vitamin B12 is
also necessary for myelin sheath formation and maintenance. The body uses its Bi2stores very economically, _reabsorbing
vitamin B12 from the ileum and returning it to the liver so that very little is excreted.

Clinical and laboratory findings for B12 deficiency include neurological abnormalities, decreased serum B12 levels, and increased
excretion of methylmalonic acid. The impaired DNA synthesis associated with vitamin B12 deficiency causes macrocytic anemias.
These anemias are characterized by abnormal maturation of erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow, which results in the
presence of megaloblasts and in decreased erythrocyte survival. Pernicious anemia is a macrocytic anemia caused by vitamin B12
deficiency that is due to lack of intrinsic factor. Low vitamin B12 intake, gastrectomy, diseases of the small intestine,
malabsorption, and trans-cobalamin deficiency can also cause vitamin B12 deficiency.

Summary

Homocysteine (Hcy) is a thiol-containing amino acid produced by the intracellular demethylation of methionine. Total
homocysteine (tHcy) represents the sum of all forms of Hcy including forms of oxidized, proteinbound and free. Elevated levels of
tHcy has emerged as an important risk factor in the assessment of cardiovascular disease. Excess Hcy in the blood stream may
cause injuries to arterial vessels due to its irritant nature, and result in inflammation and plaque formation, which may eventually
cause blockage of blood flow to the heart. Elevated tHcy levels are caused by four major factors, including:

1. Genetic deficiencies in enzymes involved in Hcy metabolism such as cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), methionine synthase
(MS), and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR);

2. Nutritional deficiency in B vitamins such as B6, B12 and folate;

3. Renal failure for effective amino acid clearance;

4. Drug interactions, such as with nitric oxide, methotrexate and phenytoin that interfere with Hcy metabolism. Elevated levels of
tHcy are also linked with Alzheimer disease, Neuropsychiatric diseases and Osteoporosis.

COMMENTS

 

Immunoglobulin E (IgE) : It most significant parameter for allergic information. The level of IgE is low during the first year of life
and it gradually increases with age and reaches adult levels after 10 years. IgE is a major mediator of allergic response, therefore
its measurement can provide useful information for differential diagnosis of atopic and non-atopic disease.

Increased Levels of IgE seen in: 1). Atopic/Non-atopic disorders 2). Hyper IgE syndrome 3). Parasitic infections
4). Pulmonary Aspergillosis 5). Immunodeficiency states 6). Autoimmune diseases.

 

- To evaluate children with strong family history of allergies and adults having allergic respiratory disease, helps establish the
diagnosis and define the allergens.

- To confirm sensitivity to foods in patients with Anaphylactic sensitivity or with Asthma, Angioedema or Cutaneous disease.

- To evaluate sensitivity to insect venom allergens clinically.

- To confirm the presence of IgE antibodies to certain occupational allergens.

Comments

 

Prolactin is synthesized in the anterior pituitary and is secreted in episodes. The target organ for prolactin is the mammary gland,
the development and differentiation of which is promoted by this hormone. High concentrations of prolactin have an inhibiting
action on steroidogenesis of the ovaries and on hypophyseal gonadotropin production and secretion. During pregnancy the
concentration of prolactin rises under the influence of elevated estrogen and progesterone production. The stimulating action of
prolactin on the mammary gland leads post partum to lactation. Hyperprolactinemia (in men and women) is the main cause of
fertility disorders. The determination of prolactin is utilized in the diagnosis of anovular cycles, hyperprolactinemic amenorrhea
and galactorrhea, gynecomastia and azoo-spermia.

Note

Prolactin Value may be high in early morning samples or soon after waking up. Pooled sample is advised for an accurate
estimation of Prolactin Levels.
